<p>Use Camtasia to edit video recordings and send them to TechSmith Relay. With the TechSmith Relay plug-in, you can publish your videos without having to make any difficult decisions about the file format or publishing location. Simply log in with the same credentials you use for TechSmith Relay and submit your video recording. The video is processed and published automatically. You can also add quizzes and track viewing analytics  from directly within TechSmith Relay.</p>
  <p>You must download TechSmith Relay Recorder from your organization's TechSmith Relay website to share to TechSmith Relay. Log in to the website and click the Download Recorder button. Contact your administrator if you:
				<ul>
				  <li>Do not have TechSmith Relay Recorder installed and do not know the URL for your organization's TechSmith Relay website.</li>
				  <li>Can log in to your organization's TechSmith Relay website, but cannot find the Download Recorder button.</li></ul>
				    <p>Note: TechSmith Relay members must have content creation privileges to share videos to TechSmith Relay. Privileges are set by your organization's administrator.</p>
