  <h1>Analyze Panel View</h1>
  <p>Since the targets may contain a deep, nested hierarchy of files, there may be a great number of files that are candidates for synchronization. The hierarchical view for each folder can be expanded or collapsed to disclose or hide the contents of that folder. This makes the display more manageable.</p>
<div class="box task">
<h2>To expand/collapse a folder&#146;s contents:</h2>
  	<ol>
   	    <li>Click the triangle icon that appears at the left of the folder name. This is known as a disclosure triangle.</li>
        <li>When the triangle points to the right, the folder is collapsed and its contents aren&#146;t displayed.</li>
        <li>When it is pointing down, the folder is expanded, and its contents will appear (unless it is empty).</li>
  	</ol>
</div>
<p class="inform">Note: To view all sub-folders within a folder,  OPTION-click onto that folder.</p>
<div class="box task">
<h2>Look inside folders:</h2>
  	<ol>
   	    <li>If you have deeply nested files, take advantage of the folder tunneling option to view the contents of any folder.  Double-click a folder and it opens up in the analyze outline view.</li>
        <li>Use the popup menu above the panel to walk the folder's path.</li>
        <li>To the right of the popup menu are two arrow buttons. The arrow pointing to the left allows you to go back one folder level. The arrow pointing up allows you to go to the top folder level.</li>
  	</ol>
