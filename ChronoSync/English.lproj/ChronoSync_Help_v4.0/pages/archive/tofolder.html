  <h1>Specific Folder Restore</h1>
  <p>When you restore a file to a specifc folder location, you have the option of recreating the parent folders' structure or restoring the file, individually, to that location. If you choose to recreate the parent folders, the file will be restored with its original folder hierarchy, meaning the parent folders of that file will be restored as well. Only the folder structure gets restored, not any files within the folder structure - except, of course, the file you chose to be restored. An example of each is shown below.</p>
<div class="box task">
  <h2>Restoring a file and recreating its parent folders:</h2>
	<ol>
  		<li>In this example, the &quot;addSchedule.jpg&quot; file will be restored. From the graphic below, you can see that this file, which is highlighted, is in the &quot;images&quot; folder. This folder is within the &quot;ChronoSync_Help_v4.0&quot; folder. So, the path of &quot;addSchedule.jpg&quot; is: ChronoSync_Help_v4.0/images.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
  <div align="center"><img src="../../images/archiveHierarchy.jpg" class="screenshot" /></div>
<div class="box task">
	<ol start="2">
  		<li>To restore this file with the entire path (ChronoSync_Help_v4.0/images) intact, choose &quot;Restore-&gt;From Archive&quot; from the &quot;Actions&quot; menu, select &quot;Specific Folder&quot; on the &quot;Restore from Archive&quot; sheet and choose &quot;Restore&quot;.</li>
   	  <li>You should now see the file browse sheet. Navigate to the location you wish to restore the selected file. In this example, &quot;addSchedule.jpg&quot; will be restored to the Desktop. Make sure "Recreate parent folders" is checked. By default, it is.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  <div align="center"><img src="../../images/archiveSaveTo.jpg" class="screenshot" /></div>
<div class="box task">
	<ol start="4">
  		<li>Once you choose &quot;Select&quot;, a restore verification sheet will be displayed.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  <div align="center"><img src="../../images/restoreComplete.jpg" class="screenshot" /></div>
<div class="box task">
	<ol start="5">
  		<li>The Finder window graphic below shows the file and its parent folders after restoring it. As you can see, the folder structure was retained and restored along with the selected file. Note that no other files that may have been within these folders were restored. Just the one you had selected.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  <div align="center"><img src="../../images/finderHierarchy.jpg" class="screenshot" /></div>
<div class="box task">
  <h2>Restoring a file individually (not recreating its parent folders):</h2>
	<ol>
  		<li>In this example, the "addSchedule.jpg" file will be restored again. You already know from the above example that the path of the file is: ChronoSync_Help_v4.0/images.</li>
      <li>To restore this file without the entire path (ChronoSync_Help_v4.0/images) intact, choose "Restore" from the &quot;Actions&quot; menu, select "Specific Folder" on the &quot;Restore from Archive&quot; sheet and choose &quot;Restore&quot;.</li>
      <li>You should now see the file browse sheet. Navigate to the location you wish to restore the selected file. Again, "addSchedule.jpg" will be restored to the Desktop. Make sure "Recreate parent folders" is NOT checked.</li>
  	</ol>
</div>
<div align="center"><img src="../../images/restoreNoHierarchy.jpg" class="screenshot" /></div>
<div class="box task">
	<ol start="4">
  		<li>Once you choose Select, a restore verification sheet will be displayed.</li>
        <li>The Finder window graphic below shows the file without its parent folders after restoring it. It restores just itself.</li>
  	</ol>
