  <h1>The Document List</h1>
  <p>The document list 
  displays all of your synchronizer and container documents. It's a convenient and handy way to have all of your documents in one place. If you have a handful of documents that you use regularly, accessing them via the document list is much faster than finding them in Finder and accessing them that way.
  </p><p>Note: The mechanism for tracking documents was introduced in version 4.4. Therefore, if you are updating from version 4.4 and you have synchronizer or container documents that were edited in version 4.4, your list of documents will be pre-populated with your edited version 4.4 documents. If, on the other hand, you didn't edit any documents in version 4.4 or if you are installing ChronoSync cleanly or over another version other than version 4.4, your list will be empty.</p>
  <p>If your document list is empty, populating it is as simple as opening documents to view or edit them. Once your list is populated with documents, you'll be able to perform the various actions allowed in the window.</p>
  <p>The list of documents can be viewed by choosing "All" &#8212; view ALL documents &#8212; or by choosing "Recent" &#8212; view the most RECENT documents. You'll notice that the documents in &quot;View: All&quot; are sorted alphabetically while the documents in &quot;View: Recent&quot; are sorted by the &quot;Last opened&quot; date.</p>
  <p>Right-clicking (or ctrl-clicking) on a document will bring up a contextual menu of actions that can be done on that document. For more information on this, read about <a href="list-actions.html">document</a> list actions.</p>
