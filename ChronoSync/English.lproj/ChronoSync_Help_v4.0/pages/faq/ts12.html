  	<h2>I've scheduled a synchronization but it won't run.</h2>
    <p>First, check that you've scheduled the synchronization correctly. If this is the only scheduled item, the &quot;Scheduled Documents Manager&quot; will display the date and time of the next scheduled synchronization. If this doesn't match what you intended, edit the scheduled entry and correct your mistake. If you have multiple items already scheduled, just temporarily disable all the others so that the one you just added is the only active scheduled item. You can then examine the next scheduled synchronization date and time for accuracy.</p>
    <p>Second, make sure your Mac and the device you are synchronizing with are available at the time of the scheduled synchronization. For example, if you've setup a Synchronizer document that mounts a file server automatically, but have saved the Synchronizer document on the file server, ChronoSync wont be able to load the Synchronizer document to mount the file server for you!</p>
<p>Last, check to see if your computer is scheduled to fall asleep at the intended time of synchronization. If your Mac is asleep during the scheduled time, it won't synchronize, but should attempt a synchronization immediately upon waking up. You can have ChronoSync automatically wake your computer at the scheduled time by turning on the &#147;Wake system to synchronize&#148; feature in the ChronoSync &quot;Preferences&quot; dialog.</p>
