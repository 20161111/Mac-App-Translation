  	<h2>What is the Archive panel and how do I activate this feature?</h2>
    <p>Archiving is a way to store or collect old files that are usually kept for backup purposes. In ChronoSync, an option can be enabled where files are archived when replacing existing files. With this option, each time a file is modified, a version of that file will be moved to the Archive folder. That way, if an old file ever needs to be used again, you can view it and access it in the Archive panel.</p>
	<p>You may also choose to move all deleted items into your Archive folder. With &quot;Synchronize Deletions&quot; turned on and &quot;Move to Archive&quot; selected, the files that get deleted will be archived.</p>
