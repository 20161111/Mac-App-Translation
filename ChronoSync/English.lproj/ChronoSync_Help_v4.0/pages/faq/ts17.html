  	<h2>I get a &quot;Preserve Comments Notice&quot; in the Options panel. What is this?</h2>
    <p>This notice informs you that having &quot;Ignore invisibles&quot; disabled while &quot;Preserve comments&quot; is enabled may be redundant. This is because the invisible '.DS_Store file, which contains the Finder/Spotlight Comments for the files in each folder where it resides, will likely get copied if &quot;Ignore invisibles&quot; is OFF. Thus turning 'Preserve comments' ON is potentially redundant since the invisible '.DS_Store file is getting copied regardless. If there are any rules and/or triggers in effect that would result in the .DS_Store file NOT getting copied, then it isn't redundant at all.</p>
    <p>Mac OS X Leopard does away with the  .DS_Store technique of associated comments with files. Instead they are saved as extended attributes, which ChronoSync preserves. Thus if running Leopard, the &quot;Preserve Comments&quot; setting may be disabled and file/folder comments may still be preserved, regardless of the &quot;Ignore invisibles&quot; setting. Doing so would increase performance. The one exception to this is if you upgraded from Tiger (or older) and had a bunch of old files with comments - these are still using .DS_Store to associate the comments, at least until they are modified under Leopard.</p>
