  	<h2>Can I do a bi-directional synchronization between two different operating systems?</h2>
    <p>Yes. You can synchronize certain files, like document files, between any OS that your Mac can copy to. For instance, you can synchronize your Documents between Yosemite and El Capitan or even El Capitan and Windows 8. However, you can only perform a Home-to-Home sync between the same version of Mac OS X, meaning you must sync El Capitan to El Capitan. Furthermore, you need to make sure that your iApps like Photos and iTunes are the same version. If you are unsure if you can synchronize a particular scenario, ask us by filling out our <a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/support/open-ticket.php">support form</a> describing your situation.</p>
