  	<h2>I want to keep the data files on my work computer synchronized with my home computer. How can I do this?</h2>
    <p>Connecting and synchronizing two Macs is easy if they are both on the same network. However, if the two Macs can not be connected, you can still keep them synchronized. How? Use an external hard drive and follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Setup a bidirectional synchronization between your work Mac and the (empty) external hard drive. Save the Synchronizer document locally on your work computer.</li>
        <li>Perform the synchronization using the document you just created.</li>
        <li>Take the hard drive home and set up a bidirectional synchronization between your home Mac and the external hard drive. Save the Synchronizer document locally on your home computer.</li>
        <li>Perform the synchronization using the document you just created.</li>
        <li>When you are finished working at home, run the Synchronizer document again to synchronize your changes back to the hard drive.</li>
        <li>When you return to work, connect the hard drive to your computer and run the Synchronizer document you created in step 1.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Repeat the steps 2, 4, 5 &amp; 6 on a daily basis to keep your two computers synchronized. When you get real comfortable with the process, you may even want to set up a scheduled synchronization that will synchronize your computer and hard drive automatically whenever you plug the hard drive in.</p>
