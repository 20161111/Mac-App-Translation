  	<h2>How can I connect my laptop to my desktop so I can synchronize files?</h2>
    
	<p>Connecting to <a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/chronoagent/overview.html">ChronoAgent</a> provides a direct, unrestricted connection that is safer, faster, and more reliable than Mac OS X's built-in file sharing. ChronoAgent offers better performance and better retention of ownership and privileges. ChronoAgent allows any other Mac on your network that is running ChronoSync to have full access to the ChronoAgent Macâ€™s file system.</p>
    <p>Another method is to connect to another Mac using built-in file sharing. To do this, open the &quot;System Preferences&quot; on the computer you want to share files with and enable &quot;File Sharing&quot; in the &quot;Sharing&quot; preference pane (you only need to do this on ONE of your computers). Then, on the other computer, you can use Finder's &quot;Network&quot; browser to locate the shared computer. Double click it to login. Once connected, the shared computer appears as just another hard drive on your desktop and it can be specified as a target in ChronoSync.</p>
