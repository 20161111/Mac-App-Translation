  	<h2>I don't want some of the files and folders in my targets to synchronize. How can I get ChronoSync to skip them?</h2>
    <p>From the Analyze panel, select the file or folder pair you wish to skip and then invoke the &quot;Exclude&quot; command from the &quot;Actions&quot; menu. If you exclude a folder, all the files and folders contained within it are likewise excluded.</p>
	<p>To undo an exclusion, select an excluded file/folder pair and choose &quot;Include&quot; from the &quot;Actions&quot; menu.</p>
  <p>A contextual menu will appear if you hold the CONTROL key down while selecting a file/folder pair (or right-click, if you have a two button mouse). This menu contains all the actions available to you. Also, shortcuts to the &quot;Exclude&quot; and &quot;Include&quot; actions can be placed on your toolbar. <a href="../misc/toolbar.html">Customizing the toolbar</a> is discussed elsewhere in the online help as well as in the ChronoSync manual.</p>
	<p>A more advanced alternative to skip files and folders would be to create a rule to exclude certain types of files.</p>
