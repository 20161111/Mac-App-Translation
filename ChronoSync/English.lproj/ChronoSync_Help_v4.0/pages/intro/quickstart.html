  <h1>Quick Start</h1>
  <p>ChronoSync performs synchronizations from a document you create and save. Once you create and save a Synchronizer document, you always run your synchronizations or backups from the same document.</p>
<div class="box task">
<h2>Steps to Get Started with ChronoSync:</h2>
  	<ol>
    	<li><a href="../setup/syncdocs.html">Open a synchronizer document</a>.</li>
  	  <li><span class="label">Select your Targets.</span> ChronoSync keeps the files stored at two locations, called Targets, synchronized with each other. A Target can be a folder or a volume on your Mac or anywhere else. This includes other Macs, PCs, external drives or even your iDisk. To select a target, click on the "Choose" button in the Setup panel, or you can drag a folder or volume onto the target.</li>
   	  <li><span class="label">Synchronize Deletions.</span> Check the "Synchronize deletions" checkbox if you want files that are deleted on one target to be deleted on the other target. In most cases you would want to check this box so that both targets stay identical.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Be Safe - Activate Archiving.</span> Check the “Archive replaced files” checkbox to activate archiving. This is so that old files will be saved instead of deleted. They can be viewed and retrieved from the Archive panel. This will take up more hard drive space, but it is better to be safe than to lose that important file. You can change the "Archive" settings in the Options panel, under "Archive Handling".</li>
  	  <li><span class="label">Select an Operation.</span> The operation determines how your selected targets will be synchronized. The operation is selected from the popup menu labeled "Operation" at the very center of the Setup panel. The operation you choose depends entirely on the type of synchronization you wish to perform.</li>
  	  <li><span class="label">Save your Document.</span> Once you set up your Synchronizer document, save it. It is important to always synchronize using the same document because it saves all your settings and records information about every synchronization you perform.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Review your Sync.</span> Run "Trial Synchronizations" or view the Analyze panel to see a list of file changes displayed so you can see what happens before it happens.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Synchronize.</span> Once all the settings have been established and the document saved, you can just click the large synchronization button that appears between your targets. This button shows the direction in which files will be copied.</li>
  	</ol>

<p>The steps above are the basic steps to get you familiar with ChronoSync. Before running any synchronization for the first time, it is a good idea to make sure you have set up everything correctly.
