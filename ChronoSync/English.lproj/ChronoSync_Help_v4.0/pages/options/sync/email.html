  <h1>Notifications</h1>
<p>Synchronization notifications can give you peace of mind after a synchronization runs. ChronoSync can post notifications to the Notification Center or you can receive notifications in email. Both methods allow you to view a summary of the synchronization and ensure that it was run without errors. Setting an email notification can be especially useful when you want to monitor computers that you don't have direct access to.</p>

<p>ChronoSync defaults to sending email via Apple Mail. If you want to change this, visit the &quot;<a href="../../prefs/general.html">General</a>&quot; panel in &quot;Preferences&quot;. Aside from Apple Mail, there are  other popular clients that are supported.  ChronoSync can also send email directly without using an email client at all.</p>
