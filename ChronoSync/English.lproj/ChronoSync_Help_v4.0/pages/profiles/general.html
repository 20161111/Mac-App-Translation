  <h1>Connections -- General</h1>
  <p>In the General panel, you can define a connection profile so that you can connect to a remote or local agent or to an InterConneX sharespace. To connect to an agent remotely, you must have <a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/chronoagent/overview.html" target="_blank">ChronoAgent</a> installed on the remote machine, the one you wish to access. To connect to an InterConneX sharespace, you must have <a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/interconnex/overview.html">InterConneX</a> installed on your desired device..</p>
