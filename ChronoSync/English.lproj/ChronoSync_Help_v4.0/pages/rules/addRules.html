  <h1>Adding Rules</h1>
  <p>The &quot;Intermediate&quot; and &quot;Advanced&quot; rules can be a bit  involved. There are no predefined rules. Instead you must explicitly add rules to the rule base. There is a great amount of flexibility with both of these modes. In the &quot;Intermediate&quot; mode, rules are added to an inclusion list. An inclusion list contains rules that a file must pass to be considered for synchronization.</p>
  <p>In the &quot;Advanced&quot; mode, rules are added to both an inclusion and an exclusion list. As mentioned above, the inclusion list contains rules that a file must pass to be considered for synchronization. The exclusion list, on the other hand, list rules that, if a file passes, excludes them from consideration.</p>
<div class="box task">
  <h2>To add a rule to an inclusion or exclusion list:</h2>
	<ol>
  		<li style="line-height:20px;">Click on the <img src="../../images/plus.png" width="21" height="20" /> icon.</li>
    	<li>From the drop down sheet, choose &quot;Create your own rule of the following type:&quot; and then the type of rule you wish to add.</li>
  	</ol>

  <div align="center"><img src="../../images/RuleChoice.jpg" class="screenshot" /></div>
<div class="box task">
	<ol start="3">
  		<li>Select &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
    	<li>The rule's setup sheet will appear where you can now input the information you want for that rule.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
        <li>You will now see that the rule appears in the &quot;Rules&quot; panel list.</li>
