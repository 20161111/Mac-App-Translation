  <h1>Container Documents</h1>
  <p>A Container is a document that contains multiple ChronoSync documents. They allow you to control several ChronoSync documents as if they were one document.</p>
  <p>Running a synchronization on a container will execute each contained document in order. You cannot run Trial Synchronizations with Container documents. If you wish to run a trial synchronization, it must be done on each individual Synchronizer document since one synchronization might affect the outcome of another.</p>
  <p>Container documents have their own independent log and may be individually scheduled just like regular ChronoSync documents.</p>
  <p>Documents may be added to or removed from the container by simply dragging them in and out or by selecting “Add...” or “Remove” from the toolbar. Just as with any other document based application, Container documents may be saved to disk.</p>
<div class="box task">
<h2>A new &quot;Untitled&quot; Container document can be created by either:</h2>
  	<ul>
   	    <li>Choosing &quot;New&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu and then selecting &#147;Container&#148;.</li>
        <li>Choosing &quot;Create a new container document&quot; in the Document Organizer window.</li>
      <li>Using the shortcut keys, SHIFT-COMMAND-N.</li>
  	</ul>
  <p></p>
</div>
<p>If you have the "Maintain documents folder:" preference setting enabled, when you open a new, untitled container document, a sheet drops down so that you can specify a filename, if you desire. The folder that is chosen is where the new document will be kept.</p>
