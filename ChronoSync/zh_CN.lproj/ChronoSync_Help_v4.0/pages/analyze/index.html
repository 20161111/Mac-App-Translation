  <h1>Analyze</h1>
  <p>The Analyze panel presents a hierarchal view of files contained in both targets. It shows the synchronization status of these files and provides helpful information concerning each file.</p>
<p>Using the Analyze panel you can review, compare and control your syncs. The current status of both the Left and Right targets are displayed so you can see what is in or out of sync. Take a look at the <a href="icons.html">Analyze panel icons</a> to see a list of all the possible file statuses.</p>
<p>You may also control how files and folders are handled during a synchronization by selecting them and issuing commands like "Exclude" to omit that file from syncing.</p>
<p>For peace of mind, you can run <a href="trialsync.html">trial synchronizations</a> before actually synchronizing. In a Trial Synchronization window, you can analyze only the files that have changed so you can see what files are to be synchronized. Several of the commands provided in the Analyze panel are also available in the Trial Synchronization window.</p>
