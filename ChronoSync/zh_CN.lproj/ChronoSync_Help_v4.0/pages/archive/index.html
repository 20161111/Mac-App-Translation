  <h1>Archive</h1>
  <p>Archiving data refers to having multiple backup copies of your data that were made at various points in time. This maintains a ‘history’ of your data. The Archive panel presents a hierarchal view of the files placed in the Archive folder. This panel allows you to view and manipulate the contents of these files. Such actions allowed are review, delete and restore.</p>
  <p>To activate the Archive panel, one of the following settings must be set. These settings can be found in the Setup panel:</p> 
  <ul>  
  	<li>"Archive replaced files" or</li>
    <li>"Synchronize Deletions/Move to Archive"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Archiving behavior can be controlled in the <a href="../options/sync/archivehandling.html">Options</a> panel. It is important to note that archiving files will consume disk space, so limiting the size of your archive is almost always something that you will want to do. Compressing files added to the archive is advantageous when space is an issue. Setting files to be compressed, though, will slow down the performance of the synchronization. </p>
