  <h1>The Archive Panel</h1>
  <p>The list view of the Archive panel makes it easy to find, sort and manage your archived files. You can quickly find the file's name, type, version number, archive date and file date. You can also open or restore any older version of a file. An archive is maintained on your destination target. Thus if the synchronization is set to be  Left-to-right, the archive is on the right target. It is the opposite for Right-to-left. For bidirectional synchronizations, each target has their own archive. In the bidirectional case, you need to pay close attention to which archive you are restoring from.</p>
