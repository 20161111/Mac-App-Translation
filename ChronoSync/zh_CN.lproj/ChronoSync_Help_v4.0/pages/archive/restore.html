  <h1>Restoring Archived Items</h1>
  <p>Restoring is used to revert back to an older version of a file, which may have been either accidentally or intentionally deleted or overwritten. When restoring, you can replace the  file on either target or you may also restore  to a specific folder on any hard drive. The latter would be used when you want to work with an older version of a file but you don't necessarily want that to become the current version of a file.</p>
