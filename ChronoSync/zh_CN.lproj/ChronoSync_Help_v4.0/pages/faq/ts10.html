  	<h2>I've setup some rules but they don't give me the desired results. What gives?</h2>
    <p>Four important points to remember about rules:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Rules determine what files are and are not considered for synchronization. Even if a file passes the rules, ChronoSync must detect that it has changed for that file to be synchronized.</li>
        <li>&quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;Intermediate&quot;-mode rules are inclusion rules. They determine what files are included for consideration. &quot;Advanced&quot;-mode rules can be either inclusion or exclusion rules and thus can exclude a file from consideration.</li>
        <li>Inclusion rules will only consider files that pass all the stated rules. Files that fail will be skipped.</li>
        <li>If you use a rule to exclude a folder, ChronoSync will not examine ANY of the files or folders within it.</li>
    </ol>
