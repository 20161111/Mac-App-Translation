  	<h2>I've setup some rules but I don't want to synchronize to see if they're correct. How can I check my rules?</h2>
    <p>You can visibly see the results of a synchronization before it occurs by checking the status of the file-pairs in the Analyze panel. You can also run a &quot;Trial Synchronization&quot; to see all the files that ChronoSync intends to synchronize, and &quot;Cancel&quot; the operation if you aren't satisfied.</p>
  <p>Turn ON &quot;Show all entries&quot; in the Analyze panel to see files that are rule excluded, depicted by the following: <img src="../../images/xaRuleSkip.png" hspace="3" vspace="2" />.</p>
