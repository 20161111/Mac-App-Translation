  	<h2>I want to synchronize the files on two Macs. Do I need to install ChronoSync on each computer to do this?</h2>
    <p>No. If you are synchronizing between two computers, you only need to install ChronoSync on one of them. You simply need to mount the other computer from the Mac that you'll be running ChronoSync on. If you are connecting via file sharing, ChronoSync can automatically mount the remote computer for you.</p>
	<p>An alternate method would be to install a <a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/chronoagent/overview.html">ChronoAgent</a> on one of the Macs and create a connection profile for it. You can then connect via the profile and have the benefit of faster performance without the file ownership and access permission issues that file sharing is prone to.</p>
