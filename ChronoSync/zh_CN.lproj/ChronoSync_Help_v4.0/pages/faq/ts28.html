  	<h2>What is ChronoAgent?</h2>
    <p>ChronoSync has the ability to synchronize targets by communicating with "agents". An agent is simply a faceless program that runs external to ChronoSync. It can be installed on the same machine as ChronoSync or on another computer and accessed via a network connection. <a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/chronoagent/overview.html">ChronoAgent</a> is installed via a separate installer. It can be installed on any Mac running Mac OS 10.5 or greater. The ChronoAgent, or remote agent, gives ChronoSync full root access to destination Macs.</p>

<h2>The advantages of synchronizing via agents are numerous:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Full administrative access to all files regardless of the privileges of the logged in user who is running ChronoSync.</li>
	<li>The ability to communicate with remote machines.</li>
    <li>WAN access settings to connect to an agent over the internet.</li>
	<li>Users don't need to be locally logged into remote machines.</li>
	<li>User/group ID mapping between machines.</li>
	<li>Limitations of an AFP connection are circumvented.</li>
	<li>In the future, agents can be written that run on non-Mac OS X based systems.</li>
</ul>
