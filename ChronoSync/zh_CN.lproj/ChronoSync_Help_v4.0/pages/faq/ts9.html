  	<h2>I want to synchronize multiple folders but I can only select one folder as my target. How can I do this?</h2>
    <p>ChronoSync is a very flexible application, so there are lots of ways to handle multiple folders.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Select a root folder above all of the folders you want to sync and then use the &quot;Exclude&quot; action to skip the folders you do not want to synchronize.</li>
        <li>Create multiple ChronoSync documents for each folder you want to synchronize and combine them as one in a Container document.</li>
        <li>Create rules to exclude folders you don&#146;t want to synchronize or rules to include only the folders you do want to synchronize. The &quot;Finder Labels&quot; rule is very useful for this because you can control what gets synchronized by changing its color label in the Finder.</li>
        <li>Use a combination of the above concepts. For instance, suppose you want to synchronize your entire Home folder but want to skip everything inside your Library folder with the exception of Mail (located inside Library). You could create a Synchronizer document to synchronize your entire Home folder but exclude your entire Library folder. Then you would create a second Synchronizer document to synchronize just your Mail folder. Finally you would combine both Synchronizer documents into a single Container document.</li>
    </ul>
