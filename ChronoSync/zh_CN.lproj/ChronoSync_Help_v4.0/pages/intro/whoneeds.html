  <h1>Why ChronoSync?</h1>
<p>With ChronoSync, you can synchronize, backup and create bootable backups. ChronoSync can synchronize or backup to almost anything you can connect to your Mac. That includes folders on your Mac, other Macs, PC's, external drives, NAS drives, or anything you can mount to your Mac. The situations in which synchronization is necessary are quite numerous and varied. ChronoSync offers a tremendous degree of flexibility so that virtually any synchronization scenario can be handled.</p>

  <h2>Backup</h2>
  <p>The most common need for synchronization is to simply maintain a redundant backup of your data. In this case, all the changes made in one target, the main target, will get copied over to another target, the backup target. The user rarely, if ever, directly accesses files on the backup target - they exist merely as a backup in case one of the files on the main target is accidentally deleted or becomes corrupt.</p>
  <h2>Syncing</h2>
  <p>Another common need for ChronoSync is to keep two sets of files that are actively modified in sync with each other. A perfect example is a laptop and desktop computer. You may work on certain files on your desktop in your office. You may then want to bring the same files home on your laptop so you can work on them at night or on a business trip. When you return to the office, any changes you made to the files on your laptop need to be copied back to your desktop.</p>
  <h2>Bootable Backup</h2>
  <p>A bootable backup (or clone) is an exact copy of your entire system hard drive. The operating system, applications, your data files and all configuration settings get replicated on the second drive. The advantage of <a href="../setup/bootable.html">having a bootable backup</a> is that if something goes wrong with your primary system drive, you can boot from the backup drive and be up and running with minimal downtime.</p>
