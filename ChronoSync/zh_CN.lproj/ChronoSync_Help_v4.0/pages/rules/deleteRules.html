  <h1>Deleting Rules</h1>
  <p>While in the &quot;Simple&quot; rule mode, there is no way to delete a rule. You can, however, disable a rule so that it will not be considered for synchronization. To do this, simply uncheck the rule that you no longer wish to have.</p>
  <p>In the &quot;Intermediate&quot; or &quot;Advanced&quot; rule-base mode, rules in either the inclusion or exclusion list may be easily deleted by following the steps below.</p>
<div class="box task">
  <h2>To delete a rule from an inclusion or exclusion list:</h2>
	<ol>
  		<li>Select the rule that you wish to delete by highlighting it in the list.</li>
    	<li style="line-height:20px;">Click on the <img src="../../images/minus.png" alt="" width="21" height="20"> icon.</li>
        <li>When the warning message appears, verify deletion by choosing &quot;Remove&quot;.</li>
        <li>The rule will no longer appear in the list.</li>
  	</ol>
