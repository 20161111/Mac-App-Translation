  <h1>Rule Groups</h1>
  <p>Rule groups act much like parenthesis do in a mathematical expression. A rule group is evaluated as a whole and the result is applied to the next rule or rule group in the expression. The entire rule group must evaluate to TRUE - and any other rules that may be set - for the file to be included or excluded.</p>
<div class="box task">
  <h2>Some advantages of using rule groups are as follows:</h2>
	<ul>
  		<li>Keep certain rules grouped together.</li>
    	<li>Contain multiple rules evaluated by AND and OR relationships.</li>
        <li>Allow a set of multiple rules to be saved as a single rule template.</li>
        <li>Can be nested as deeply as you like.</li>
  	</ul>

  <h2>Follow these steps to add a Rule Group:</h2>
	<ol>
  		<li style="line-height:20px;">While in &quot;Intermediate&quot; or &quot;Advanced&quot; rule mode, select <img src="../../images/group.png" alt="" width="21" height="20"> located above the list.</li>
    	<li>Name your rule group.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;OK&quot; and you'll then see it appear in the list.</li>
        <li>Rules can be added by highlighting the rule group and adding a new rule or by dragging previously defined rules into the group.</li>
  	</ol>
