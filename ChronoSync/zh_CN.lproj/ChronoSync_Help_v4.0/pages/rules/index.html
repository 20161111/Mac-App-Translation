  <h1>Rules</h1>
  <p>The ability to define file selection rules is a powerful feature for narrowing down the scope of the synchronization. There are three types of rules -- &quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;Intermediate&quot;, and &quot;Advanced&quot; -- that allow you to customize each synchronization.</p>
  <p>There is a great amount of flexibility with both the &quot;Intermediate&quot; and &quot;Advanced&quot; rule modes. In the &quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;Intermediate&quot; modes, rules are added to an inclusion list. Any file that passes the rules listed in the inclusion list are considered for synchronization. That means any file that does not pass a rule is excluded.</p>
  <p>In the &quot;Advanced&quot; mode, rules are added to both an inclusion and an exclusion list. As mentioned above, the inclusion list contains rules that a file must pass to be considered for synchronization. The exclusion list, on the other hand, list rules that, if a file passes, excludes them from consideration. If using inclusion and exclusion rules together, the exclusion rules only apply to files and folders that pass an inclusion rule.</p>

  	<p>To see how rules will effect the outcome of your synchronizations before you run an actual synchronization, you can run "<a href="../analyze/trialsync.html">Trial Synchronizations</a>" or check the status of files in the "Analyze" panel.</p>
