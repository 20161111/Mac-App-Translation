		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<p>pg_prepare() creates a prepared statement for later execution with pg_execute() or pg_send_execute(). This feature allows commands that will be used repeatedly to be parsed and planned just once, rather than each time they are executed. pg_prepare() is supported only against PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher connections; it will fail when using earlier versions. The function creates a prepared statement named stmtname from the query string, which must contain a single SQL command. stmtname may be &quot;&quot; to create an unnamed statement, in which case any pre-existing unnamed statement is automatically replaced; otherwise it is an error if the statement name is already defined in the current session. If any parameters are used, they are referred to in the query as $1, $2, etc. Prepared statements for use with pg_prepare() can also be created by executing SQL PREPARE statements. (But pg_prepare() is more flexible since it does not require parameter types to be pre-specified.) Also, although there is no PHP function for deleting a prepared statement, the SQL DEALLOCATE statement can be used for that purpose.</p>
