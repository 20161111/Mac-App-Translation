<p>
<span class="intro">How do apps purchased in the Mac App Store differ?</span>The Mac App Store requires so-called "sandboxing" of all apps. Sandboxing puts the apps into a closed environment and restricts access to e.g. files, networks, printers, etc. Therefore many apps sold through the Mac App Store have less features than their counterparts available outside of the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Do you charge for updates in the Mac App Store?</span>No, updates are generally free in the Mac App Store (and we don't charge for them outside of the Mac App Store, too).</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Why are updates available always later that in your shop?</span>All apps sold through the Mac App Store are reviewed by Apple before being released. Therefore new versions appear immediately on the DEVONtechnologies website but have to pass Apple's review before appearing also in the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Do I get a license code?</span>Apps purchased in the Mac App Store do not come with a license code but are "signed" directly before downloading for your iTunes account.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Do you offer bundles in the Mac App Store?</span>No, bundles are not supported by the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">How can I upgrade apps purchased in the Mac App Store?</span>By Apple's rigid rules you couldn't. Upgrades are simply not available on the Mac App Store and upgrade offers outside of the Mac App Store are not allowed. In some of our apps there may be an upgrade option still available, though. Check the <a href="readme-installing.html#">Read Me</a> to see if this is the case for you.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Can I get a refund?</span>We freely refund licenses purchased in our own shop. For apps purchased in the Mac App Store we don't have access to the refund mechanism. Please contact Apple's Mac App Store support for a refund.</p>
