<span class="intro">Why does DEVONthink Pro Office not accept my license code?</span>When you enter your license code and the 'Register' button stayes greyed out, try to enter ALL details, including your name and organisation, EXACTLY as they appear in our e-mail. Best practice is to copy-and-paste name, organisation (if entered) and license code from our email into the appropriate fields of the registration dialogue window. Also, please check if you have obtained the correct code for the correct edition of your software (e.g., a DEVONthink Pro license code will not work for DEVONthink Pro Office and vice versa) as well as version (DEVONthink 2.x will not accept a 1.x license code).</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">I have lost my license code. How can I retrieve it?</span>Use <em>Help &gt; Support Assistant</em> to open the Support Assistant which has an option to get your license code resent to you. Alternatively visit the <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=support" target="_blank" class="weblink">support area</a> on our web site.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Does my license code work also for an older version?</span>Yes, it does. All our license codes are backward-compatible to legacy versions of the same product and edition.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Why do I have to enter my license code again?</span>You only have to re-enter your license code after a complete reinstall of your system without a backup of your home folder or when the license code file has been deleted, e.g. by a preferences cleaner app. The license code is stored in a preference file in '~/Library/Preferences' (where ~ is your home folder). As long as this file is intact, you'll NEVER have to enter your license code again.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Why does my DEVONthink Pro Office 1.x license not work anymore?</span>DEVONthink Pro Office with version numbers greater than 1.x are paid upgrades. To use them you may need a new license code. Please use <em>
<a href="menus-application.html#">DEVONthink Pro Office &gt; Check Upgrade Options</a>
</em> to find out what you need to upgrade and how much the upgrade is for you.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Why does your application say that it expired?</span>When we release a public beta of one of our applications, we remove the usual trial restrictions but make it expire at the end of the beta period. A new public beta or the final release is, of course, available when this happens.</p>
<p>Please simply visit our <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=download" target="_blank" class="weblink">Download page,</a> download a newer version that the one you have installed, and replace your copy with the newer one. FPlease first move the old application to the trash, then move the new one into its place.</p>
