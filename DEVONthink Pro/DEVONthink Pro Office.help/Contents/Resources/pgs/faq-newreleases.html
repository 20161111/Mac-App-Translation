<span class="intro">When is the next release coming</span>We try not to announce precise timelines or feature lists for future releases, as we are a small software company with limited development resources; if one of us should happen to get the sniffles, or if there are other outside factors we need to devote our limited time to, it can easily impact our intended development schedules.</p>
<p>In planning releases, we try to strike a balance among:</p>
<ul>
<li>responding to customer requests,</li>
<li>the needs of our partners,</li>
<li>supporting new operating systems features,</li>
<li>providing consistent features across the product line,</li>
<li>working efficiently within the structure of the code, (similar features often get handled at the same time),</li>
<li>various business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot make any assumptions on how those various factors will impact our daily workflow; in fact, it's often impossible to predict the final release date accurately when we start new projects. We try to plan our releases with a long term perspective so that they ultimately serve the needs of our customers, even if they don't necessarily get in everyone's favorite feature request every time.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Why are your applications not compatible with my pre-release version of Mac OS X?</span>In the past, we've noted that compatibility issues with a new major release of the operating system are usually resolved by Apple in the final stages before its release, and don't require any action on our part. If you are already using a pre-release version of Mac OS X, please check if our applications work with a newer pre-release, or wait until it reaches the release candidate status. We will then make all necessary adjustments for making our apps run on the first official release of the new version of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Any chance of a Windows versions of your products?</span>We're very commited to Mac OS X and the superior Cocoa environment. For most of our applications, porting them to Windows would take longer than it would to rewrite them from scratch on the Mac. If you need to use Windows software but still don't want to miss our products consider <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" class="weblink">running Windows on a Mac.</a>
