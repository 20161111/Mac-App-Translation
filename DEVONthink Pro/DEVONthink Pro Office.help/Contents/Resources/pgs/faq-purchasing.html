<p>
<span class="intro">How do I purchase an upgrade?</span>Please use <em>
<a href="menus-application.html#">DEVONthink Pro Office &gt; Check Upgrade Options</a>
</em> to find out what you need to upgrade and how much the upgrade is for you. If this option is not available in your copy of DEVONthink Pro Office this application might not be upgradable. Please visit the <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=upgrade" target="_blank" class="weblink">Upgrade Assistant</a> on our web site instead.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">What is your policy on software updates?</span>Usually, all minor updates ('dot updates', such as version 1.2 to 1.3) to our applications are free and require neither purchasing an upgrade nor requesting a fresh license code. We charge for major upgrades, though, such as version 1.x to 2.x. If you purchased your license in our online shop within a reasonable time frame before a paid upgrade release (between 30 days and 6 months, announced on our website), we will provide you with a free upgrade. If you purchased this application on the Mac App Store <a href="faq-appstore.html#">click here.</a>
</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Can I get the bundle discount also later?</span>Bundles are cheaper than multiple single licenses because a bundle means less fees for the shop provider. But we grant the bundle discount under certain circumstances. Please <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=contact" target="_blank" class="weblink">contact our sales staff</a> if you purchased one of the bundled produts within the last two weeks.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Do you give a discount to students and educators?</span>Yes, we give 25 percent off the regular price of DEVONthink, DEVONagent, DEVONnote and the Infoworker's Bundle to students and educators. We also give volume discounts to institution or faculties. Please visit our <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=students" target="_blank" class="weblink">Students, Educators and NPOs</a> page.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Do you offer NPO licenses?</span>Yes, we offer free licenses to non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the sense of charities. <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=students" target="_blank" class="weblink">Learn more about our NPO program.</a>
</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Can I use your software on multiple computers?</span>Yes, our license explicitly allows one and the same person to use our application non-simultaneously on multiple Macs. So, for example, if you install one of our products on a laptop, your office Mac, and your home Mac, you may do so as long as you only use one of them at a time.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">I have no credit card. How can I purchase your software?</span>We are selling currently through the online sales agent <a href="http://www.share-it.com" target="_blank" class="weblink">Share*It</a> to keep our administration as lean as possible. If you don't have a credit card, you can also pay via PayPal or by purchase order, wire transfer, or even cash. See our <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=shop" target="_blank" class="weblink">online shop</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In addition we are also selling some of our products through the Mac App Store. Please open the App Store application on your Mac to learn more about which payment options Apple offers.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Can I have more time for evaluating your apps?</span>No problem. We happily give out 30 day licenses for evaluation purposes. Choose <em>Help &gt; Support Assistant</em> to request a 30 day trial extension. This option is not available e.g. in DEVONagent Express.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Why haven't I received my license code(s)?</span>If you have purchased your license in our online shop and if there have been no technical problems on our side, your license codes have been sent out to you immediately after your purchase. Sometimes, however, they get stuck in spam protection filters (either yours or your ISP's). Please, check your spam protection filter, and if you cannot find the license codes there, use <em>Help &gt; Support Assistant</em> to get them resent to you. If this also doesn't work, please <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=contact" target="_blank" class="weblink">contact us</a> and we'll try to get your license codes to you as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>
<span class="intro">Where can I buy a 1.x license code, e.g. for use on Mac OS X 10.4?</span>License codes for legacy versions are no longer available in our shop but even the latest license codes are always backward-compatible: You can use a version 2.x license code also for version 1.x of the same product. To use a legacy product simply purchase a license for the most recent version of the product in our online shop and use it with your <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/redirect.html?id=legacy" target="_blank" class="weblink">legacy software.</a>
