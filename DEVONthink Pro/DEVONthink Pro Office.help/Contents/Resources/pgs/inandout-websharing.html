<p>DEVONthink Pro Office allows you to give others on the local network access to your databases using a standard web browser on any operating system (including Windows and Linux). The embedded web server provides an interactive web interface that allows you to browse, search, and manipulate all shared open databases, preview documents, and add notes to the inbox. Alternatively, it offers a simple search-engine-like search for users who don't need all the functionality of the full web interface.</p>
<a name="sharing"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Sharing a database</p>
<p>By default, DEVONthink Pro Office does not share any database. To share a database, open it, then show its properties using <em>
<a href="menus-file.html#properties">File &gt; Database Properties</a>
</em>, and check <em>Shared Database.</em> Uncheck this property to keep this database from being shared.</p>
<p>To find out the address of your shared databases, open <em>
<a href="preferences-server.html#">Preferences &gt; Server</a>
</em>. Here, you can start and stop the web server and also find your web server's address. When the web server is running, you can find DEVONthink Pro Office on any computer on your network in the Bonjour menu of your web browser.</p>
<a name="security"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Securing your shared databases</p>
<p>To keep your data away from prying eyes, make sure to either enter a user name and password in <em>
<a href="preferences-server.html#">Preferences &gt; Server</a>
</em> or set an individual password for each shared database in its <em>
<a href="windows-properties.html#">Database Properties</a>
</em>. The general user name and password is used when no password is set for a database.</p>
<a name="interactive"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Using the interactive web interface</p>
<p>The interactive web interface imitates the look-and-feel of a standard Mac application in many ways. Contrary to a static web site, it only loads once; clicking buttons or links does not reload the whole page but dynamically updates it. When the web interface is loaded, don't use the <em>Back</em> and <em>Forward</em> button of your web browser for navigation; use the user interface DEVONthink Pro Office provides.</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="../gfx/plugins/sharing-windows.png" alt="" />
</p>
<p>The web interface is divided into four areas which can be individually resized: toolbar, sidebar, documents pane, and preview pane.</p>
<p>When loaded, the sidebar shows a list of all shared databases. Click the disclosure triangle in front of each database name to show the groups it contains, just like you would do in the Finder. Select any group to show its contents in the upper right-hand pane, and select any document to show a preview, if possible, in the lower right-hand pane. This is similar to browsing mailboxes and email messages in Apple Mail.</p>
<p>
<span class="pname">Organizing your data: </span>To rearrange your groups and documents, drag them to other groups or databases just like you would do in DEVONthink Pro Office. Double-click their name to rename them, and use the <em>Delete</em> toolbar icon to move them to the trash. Click the <em>Info</em> toolbar icon to show the info panel, which allows you to change the name and URL of the item, lock or unlock it, and add or remove tags. You can also add or remove tags in the tags bar below the preview pane. Use the context menu (see below) to change an item's label, mark it read or unread, flagged or unflagged, or locked or unlocked.</p>
<p>
<span class="pname">Contextual menu and toolbar: </span>Like in native Mac applications, you can activate the contextual menu by right-clicking or clicking with the &#x2303;Control key held. The contextual menu contains useful commands tailored for the item you're pointing at. In addition, the toolbar contains a number of other useful buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="pname">Simple:</span> Switches to the <a href="inandout-websharing.html#searchonly">search-only web interface.</a>
</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Refresh:</span> Refreshes the display.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Upload Document:</span> Uploads a document from your computer to the database. The document will be placed into the currently selected group.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Download Document:</span> Downloads the selected document to the local computer.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Delete:</span> Moves the selected item into the trash.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Group +:</span> Creates a new group in the selected group or database.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">New Note:</span> Creates a new note in the database and allows you to quickly enter title, text, and some tags into the panel that appears. The document will be placed into the currently selected group</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">New Plain Text:</span> Creates a new plain text document in the currently selected group. Click into the preview area to edit it just like you would do in DEVONthink Pro Office.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Info:</span> Opens the info panel for the selected item.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">See Also:</span> Searches documents similar to the selected one. See also the <a href="drawers-seealso.html#">See Also drawer.</a>
</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Search:</span> Uses the search field to search all shared databases.You can use all operators, etc., that you can also use from within DEVONthink Pro Office. See also the <a href="windows-search.html#term">Search window.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After using the <em>search field</em> or the <em>See Also</em> button, the contents of the items pane is replaced with the search results sorted by relevance. Click the pane's close button to return to the regular display.</p>
<a name="searchonly"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Using the simple web interface</p>
<p>To switch to DEVONthink Pro Office's search-only web interface, click the <em>Simple</em> button in the interactive interface; to go back, use the <em>Browse</em> button next to the <em>Search</em> button.</p>
<div class="taskbox">
<table cellpadding="9" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">

<p>
<span class="pname note">Note: </span>Alternatively, you can directly open the search-only web interface by adding "/search" to the URL.</p>

</p>
<p>DEVONthink Pro Office's web interface works just like any other search engine. Enter your search words, select your search options, and click <em>Search.</em> The search options resemble those also found in the <a href="windows-search.html#">Search window.</a> You'll receive a ranked list of search results with options to view or download the found documents.</p>
<a name="iphone"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Using the iPhone interface</p>
<p>Accessing your database from an iPhone or iPod touch is similar to connecting to the web interface. However, DEVONthink Pro Office gives you an interface tailored to the device's screen size. It loads faster, transfers less data over the network, and is optimized for iOS-like usage like tapping.</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="../gfx/plugins/sharing-iphone.png" alt="" />
</p>
<p>To access your database from the device, simply enter your database's address <a href="preferences-server.html#">(check in Preferences &gt; Server)</a>, with JavaScript switched on in Safari for Mobile's preferences. You're automatically sent to the iOS-optimized web app. If, by chance, it does not work, e.g., because you have deactivated JavaScript, add "/iphone" (front slash-iphone) to your database's address.</p>
<p>The optimized web application simulates the look and feel of a native iOS application. Tap items, and use the <em>Back</em> button to navigate your shared databases, add new notes to the global inbox, and search all databases just like you would do on the Mac.</p>
<div class="taskbox">
<table cellpadding="9" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">

<p>
<span class="pname note">Note: </span>Due to limitations of the iOS operating system, the web application does not display certain file types. Files that cannot be displayed appear greyed out. Also, some files are opened in a second tab, which does not work when you have added the web application to your home screen. (Apps opened from the home screen cannot open a second tab.)</p>

<p class="subsection">Accessing your data over the Internet</p>
<p>To access your database from the Internet, you need to make your Mac "visible" to the outside world. In general, when you a using a DSL or cable modem, you are also using a router. Routers create an intranet that your Mac is connected to and "route" traffic between the Internet and your personal intranet. Now, you need to create a route from the outside leading to the Mac sharing your database. This offers a port on the outside that is directly connected to the port on which DEVONthink Pro Office is publishing.</p>
<p>If everything goes well, you will be able to access your database using an address like: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port, where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is your current IP address. (Note: This is your router's address, not your Mac's.) Next, port the outside port number leading to your published database.</p>
<p>
<span class="pname">Using Lighthouse: </span>An easy way to configure port forwarding is to use the shareware utility <a href="http://codelaide.com/blog/products/lighthouse" target="_blank" class="weblink">Lighthouse</a>. Usually, Lighthouse automatically finds your router and configures port forwarding for whatever ports you want. It installs as a menu extra and allows you to configure multiple settings for different applications. To set up Lighthouse for DEVONthink Pro Office, follow the instructions that come with Lighthouse. To download Lighthouse, and to learn more about how it works and how to set it up for your network, please refer to <a href="http://codelaide.com/blog/products/lighthouse" target="_blank" class="weblink">Lighthouse's homepage</a>.</p>
<p>
<span class="pname">Port forwarding done manually: </span>The following is only a rough outline of the steps needed to configure port forwarding manually. The precise way to do it varies from router to router. You will need to consult the manual for your router in order to determine exactly how to set things up. To configure port forwarding, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 1:</span> Begin by determining your Mac's public IP address. This can be done by visiting a web site like http://www.whatismyip.com/ from your machine.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 2:</span> Determine the port on which DEVONthink Pro Office published on your Mac. You set the port in DEVONthink Pro Office's <a href="preferences-server.html#">Preferences, Server tab.</a> To publish on the Internet, enter a port number here and do not let DEVONthink Pro Office set it automatically as the port number may then change every time you open the application.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 3:</span> Determine your Mac's private IP address. The IP address is usually of the form 10.x.y.z, 192.168.y.z or 172.16.y.z. You can find oyour Mac's private IP address by going to the Network preferences panel in System Preferences and looking it up under TCP/IP for the interface you are using (Built-In Ethernet or Airport).</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 4:</span> Decide on a public port for DEVONthink Pro Office. The port should be in the range 1025-65500. We suggest that you use port 8080, which is traditionally a default port for private web servers.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 5:</span> Configure port forwarding on your router. The steps to do this vary from router to router, but all of them require you to provide these details: Public port, private destination IP and private destination port. You found the private destination port in step 2, and the private destination IP in step 3, and you selected the public port in step 4. If you are in doubt about how you configure your router to do port forwarding, you need to consult the manual that came with your router. It is usually done through a web-based interface or custom-built administration application. For instance, Airport routers can be configured using the Airport Admin Utility.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 6:</span> Save the configuration changes on your router, and restart the router if required. At this point, you are ready to connect to your DEVONthink Pro Office from the outside.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Step 7:</span> From the remote computer, open a web browser and enter the address as follows: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port, where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the public IP address you found in step 1, and the public port you selected in step 4. Press Return and you should get presented with your database's web interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up port forwarding can be tricky, but the difficult part is mainly in determining how to configure your particular router. If you are in doubt, google your router's name and combine it with a seach for "port forwarding" or "port mapping."</p>
