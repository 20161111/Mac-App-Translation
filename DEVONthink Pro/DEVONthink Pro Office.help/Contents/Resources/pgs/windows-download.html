<a href="menus-window.html#">Window &gt; Download Manager</a>
</em> opens DEVONthink Pro Office's Download Manager panel. Using the Download Manager, you can download files or complete web sites from the Internet, and either store the information in your database or as files on your hard drive. Offline archives stored in DEVONthink Pro Office are also used when you visit bookmarks or open a link in a new tab and your computer is currently offline.</p>
<p class="image">

</p>
<a name="panel"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Panel elements</p>
<p>The Download Manager panel consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of a items to be downloaded</li>
<li>A status bar at the bottom</li>
<li>A <em>+ button</em> for adding items to and a <em>- button</em> for deleting selected items from the list</li>
<li>A <em>reload button</em> (backwards arrow)</li>
<li>A <em>go/stop button</em> (play/pause icons)</li>
<li>An <em>Action</em> menu (gear icon)</li>
</ul>
<a name="addingfiles"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Adding files</p>
<p>To download a web site or any other file, simply add it to the Download Manager by dragging its URL to the Download Manager panel. Alternatively, you can click the <em>+ button</em> in the panel and add the URL manually, as well as a referrer, user name, and password. If <em>Automatic</em> is checked, DEVONthink Pro Office creates a referrer automatically when downloading whole web sites.</p>
<p>You can also paste one or more URLs (copied Safari bookmarks, DEVONthink Pro Office links, or copied links from <a href="otherproducts-devonagent.html#">DEVONagent Pro's</a> Download Manager), or add files to the Download Manager by using the contextual menu in web and HTML views. &#8997; clicking a link also adds it to the Download Manager.</p>

<p>
<span class="pname note">Note: </span>You can also copy URLs in the Download Manager to the Clipboard or drag them to other applications (like the Finder or Safari's bookmark manager). The Download Manager also supports URLs for local files (POSIX path, a "file://localhost/" URL, or a "file:///" URL).</p>

<p class="subsection">The action menu</p>
<p>Most actions are available through the <em>Action</em> menu or the contextual menu. Click the <em>gear button</em> or &#x2303; click an item in the Download Manager panel to display more commands:</p>
<ul>

<li>
<span class="pname">Edit:</span> Edit the parameters of a selected item in the list.</li>

<span class="pname">Retry:</span> Attempts to reload an item that failed to download.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Remove:</span> Removes the selected items from the list. Alternatively, you can press the <em>Delete</em> key.</li>

<span class="pname">Start/Stop Queue:</span> Starts or stops the download queue. Same as the <em>play/pause</em> buttons at the bottom of the panel.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Purge Queue:</span> Removes all items from the list that have been completely downloaded.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Only Added Files to Thumbnail Gallery:</span> Offers various predefined option sets (see below).</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Import Files to Database:</span> Selects which database the downloaded files shall be stored in. Select <em>Folder</em> to save them directly to the file system.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Options:</span> Opens the options dialog sheet, which allows you to specify in detail what to download, which links to follow, and where to store the downloaded files (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>For your convenience, DEVONthink Pro Office comes with predefined option sets that you can directly select from the action menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="pname">Only Added Files:</span> Downloads only the files you have manually added to the Download Manager.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Offline Archive:</span> Downloads the files you have added to the Download Manager including embedded images, style sheets, and scripts. Use this option set to archive/download web pages with everything necessary to display them properly. Alternative: <a href="documents-html.html#">Create a web archive</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Subdirectory (Complete):</span> Downloads the files you have added to the Download Manager including all embedded or linked files. This option set follows all links leading to (items in) sub-directories. For example, use this option set to download a complete web site for offline archiving.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Subdirectory (Images &amp; Multimedia):</span> Same as above, but downloads only linked images, linked multimedia files including Flash and QuickTime movies, and embedded images in the item's directory and all sub-directories. Use this set to download a complete web site for offline archiving (without all linked Office documents, PDFs, etc.)</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Thumbnail Gallery:</span> Downloads the files you have added to the Download Manager including linked images, embedded images, style sheets, and scripts.

</div>
<a name="options"> </a>
<p class="subsection">Options</p>
<p>The options dialog defines which file types the Download Manager downloads, which links it follows, and where it stores the files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="pname">Files:</span> Check all file types you want the Download Manager to download (plain texts, rich texts, Office documents and PDF files, style sheets and scripts, images, embedded images, multimedia files, mark-up language files, etc.) Use the <em>Follow Links</em> pop-up menu to define how far DEVONthink Pro Office should follow links on the downloaded HTML pages (see below). Check <em>Overwrite existing</em> to update an existing archive.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Folder:</span> When you choose <em>Download to &gt; Folder</em> in the action menu of the Download Manager panel, DEVONthink Pro Office stores all downloaded items in the directory you specify. Click <em>Set</em> to choose your preferred location. Use this option to use the integrated Download Manager for downloading software archives or other files you don't want to store in your database. Double-click any part of the location to reveal it in the Finder.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Download:</span> Define how many connections the Download Manager opens at the same time. (Choose fewer connections for slower Internet connection, more for DSL or broadband.) Also, check <em>Automatically purge queue</em> to have previously downloaded items automatically removed from the queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Follow Links</em> options defines how far DEVONthink Pro Office follows links on the downloaded HTML pages. This feature allows you to control what gets downloaded--only the actual pages or a complete web site. DEVONthink Pro Office supports the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="pname">Off:</span> Does not follow any links.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">On Same Host:</span> Follows links, but only as long as they refer to the same web server/web site. Files on other web servers will not be downloaded.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">In Same Directory:</span> Follows links, but only as long as they refer to items in the same directory as the downloaded HTML page.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">In Subdirectories:</span> Follows links, but only as long as they refer to items in the same directory as the downloaded HTML page or its sub-directories.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">One Level:</span> Follows all links regardless of where they point to, but only one level deep. Links on pages linked to from the original page are not downloaded.</li>
<li>
<span class="pname">Two Levels:</span> Follows all links regardless of where they point to, but only two levels deep. Attention: This can result in very large downloads!</li>
