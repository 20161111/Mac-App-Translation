// comments are ignored if the // is the first two characters of the line
// some lines have spaces at the end which should be left alone.
// make sure blank lines are just a return only

/////////////////////////////////Translator Notes///////////////////////////////////
//The lines that begin with the double slash (//) like this one are comments and do not need to be translated.
//
//If you are Translating this text file into a different language, you must take
// Special care with certain characters that are used by the program for formatting.
// The following characters must be left unchanged
//---------- \t
//---------- \n
//---------- \r
//---------- \f
//---------- &
//---------- %d
//---------- %s
// Make sure that if there is a space before or after the word that it stays there. This is very important to
// The formatting of your output
// !!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL LINES OF TEXT OR DELETE THEM!!!!!!!! 
// THE ORDER THAT THESE STRINGS ARE READ IN IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!
// THE PROGRAM WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF THE STRINGS ARE READ IN THE WRONG ORDER
// IF YOU CAN'T TRANSLATE A WORD... JUST LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS. REPEAT, DO NOT DELETE LINES OF TEXT!
//
// Leave the file path name comments where they are. This will help us to debug any problems with the translation.

// THIS IS A FILE MARKER. DO NOT CHANGE THIS LINE
##Additional Strings
