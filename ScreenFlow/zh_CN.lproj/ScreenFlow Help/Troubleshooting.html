      <div class="H4Heading"><a name="1119076">How do you designate a display recording area?</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1119077">Although many screen capture programs function by designating a specific recording </a>area, ScreenFlow does not. ScreenFlow captures the entire display. This enables you to make use of the entire display during editing in post-production. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1119078">When using a program which designates a recording space, you may unexpectedly </a>move outside of this space due to a menu option or pop-up. If your recording space is preset, there is no way to recover this lost information. With ScreenFlow's reliance on post-production editing, you can move outside your area of focus when necessary.</div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1119079">If you plan on recording only a small region of the display, you may be concerned that a </a>full-screen recording will take up unnecessary disk space. ScreenFlow's adaptive recording method captures minimal information on parts of the screen where there is no action, so this has very little effect on file size, while preserving your post-production options. </div>
      <div class="H4Heading"><a name="1119062">Does ScreenFlow work with Parallels or VMware?</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1118569">Since ScreenFlow captures everything on your display, both Parallels and VMware are </a>supported (including Computer Audio output). However, ScreenFlow cannot use the Callout features, as these are dependent upon information provided by Mac OS X. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1118570">Telestream has tested ScreenFlow with Parallels in all modes (Coherence, Window, and </a>Full Screen) without issue. In fact, when using Parallels/VMware, some users have reported that ScreenFlow produces smoother, higher-quality output while using less CPU resources than native Windows screen capture programs.</div>
      <div class="H4Heading"><a name="1118572">What kind of graphics card should I use?</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1118573">ScreenFlow requires a Quartz Extreme-capable graphics card. If you are unsure if your </a>graphics card is supported, please download an evaluation version; ScreenFlow will notify you if it is not supported. You can expect most Mac hardware made in the last five years to fully support Quartz Extreme graphics cards. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1118574">ScreenFlow uses video RAM (or VRAM) during the recording process, so it is important </a>to have a graphics card with at least 64 MB of VRAM, but we recommend 128 MB. The amount of VRAM necessary to record smooth video depends on your display resolution and whether or not other applications are simultaneously using VRAM. If you have insufficient VRAM, the recording will drop frames and the video skips during playback.</div>
      <div class="H4Heading"><a name="1118576">Does ScreenFlow support audio interface or mixing devices?</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1118577">ScreenFlow does not support audio interface or mixing devices. However many of </a>these devices will work with ScreenFlow if the audio is routed properly. If you are having trouble with your mixer, we recommend posting your issue on our <span class="LinkText"><a href="http://forum.telestream.net/forum/" target="external_window">forum</a></span>. </div>

      <div class="Body"><a name="1118600">When running on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), ScreenFlow can capture directly from the </a>screen of an iOS device over a USB connection. For details, see <span class="LinkText" style="font-style: italic"><a href="Editing.07.63.html#1353177" title="Configuring Touch Callouts">Configuring Touch Callouts</a></span>.</div>
      <div class="H4Heading"><a name="1118623">My USB microphone and iSight camera are out of sync. What should I do?</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1118624">If the audio and video are out of sync, try using the audio input on the computer (not </a>the USB input) as there can be a latency problem between USB input and the iSight camera. This is particularly evident when recording a <span class="Emphasis">talking head</span>. Use a microphone that utilizes the audio input into the computer. </div>
      <div class="H4Heading"><a name="1122745">I can’t find my media files. Where is the media library?</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1122746">Each project in ScreenFlow has a media library once the first media file has been </a>recorded or the first file has been added. The media library is actually a folder inside the project itself. The media folder’s contents include .scc files and copies of externally-added media files, and are controlled by the media library as you record clips in ScreenFlow, and add and delete files. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1123613">To view the media folder, control-click (right-click) the project file in Finder and select </a>Show Package Contents. Open the Media folder to view the files in the media library for this project.</div>
