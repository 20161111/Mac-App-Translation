    <p>There are three <strong>Step commands</strong> — Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out.</p>

    <p>To <strong>issue a Step command</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Choose it from the Script menu.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Or, click the button in the toolbar.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The three Step commands differ with respect to where execution will <a href="pause.html">pause</a> afterwards. We&#8217;ll use the code in the illustration below to show what the different Step commands mean. In the illustration, we are initially paused at a breakpoint at line 9 (without yet having executed line 9).</p>

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="../../../images/stepExample.png" width="306" height="156" alt="image" /></div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step Into</strong> is the simplest. It means, &#8220;Execute the current line of code, and then, wherever the path of execution takes you, pause right there, on the next line that would be executed.&#8221;</p>

        <p>So, in the illustration above, Step Into would cause the script to pause at line 5. Why? Because line 9, where we are paused, calls the <code>pad</code> handler. So when we execute it, we&#8217;ll dive into the <code>pad</code> handler, and the next executable line where we can pause, in that path of execution, is line 5.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step Over</strong> is similar to Step Into, except that it follows an additional rule, &#8220;Don&#8217;t pause in a deeper level of the <a href="callchain.html">call stack</a> than where you are right now.&#8221;</p>

        <p>So, in the illustration above, Step Over would cause the script to pause at line 10. Why? Because that&#8217;s the next executable line that isn&#8217;t at a deeper level. Line 9, where we are paused, calls the <code>pad</code> handler, which is a deeper level, so we don&#8217;t pause until the next executable line <em>after</em> the path of execution has returned from the <code>pad</code> handler.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step Out</strong> means, &#8220;Execute until you come to the next executable line at a higher level of the <a href="callchain.html">call stack</a> than where you are right now, and then pause.&#8221;</p>

        <p>So, in the illustration above, Step Out would cause the script to pause at line 13. Why? We are paused at line 9, in <code>s</code>&#8217;s implicit run handler. We execute to the end of the run handler, which is line 10, and return from <code>s</code>&#8217;s implicit run handler. Now we are at a high level, so we want to pause. In fact, we are in line 12, because that is where <code>s</code>&#8217;s run handler was called. But we don&#8217;t pause in line 12, because if we were going to pause there, it would be <em>before</em> executing line 12 and <em>before</em> telling <code>s</code> to run. So now we&#8217;re at line 13.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>All of those details are predicated on the supposition that no <a href="breakpoi.html">breakpoints</a> are encountered. Suppose, for example, that there were an enabled breakpoint at line 5 (and assume that Script &gt; Break on Breakpoints is checked, and that this breakpoint has no <a href="breakpoifolder/breakpointsinsp.html">conditions</a>). The path of execution passes through line 5, so all three commands would do exactly the same thing — pause at line 5. Breakpoints <a href="pause.html">take priority</a>! </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Both Step Over and Step Into can be used not only to <a href="executew.html">resume</a> but also to <a href="executew.html">start execution</a> of a script. In this case they both pause before the first executable line of the script.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Both Step Over and Step Into have the same <a href="../runfolder/executefolder/handlers.html">options for executing handlers</a> as the Execute button.</p>
