    <p>Script Debugger 6 is scriptable. Moreover, you can script Script Debugger from within Script Debugger itself, either from a script window or from a script in the <a href="../menusfolder/scriptsmenu.html">Scripts menu</a>. Such a script need not include a <code>tell</code> block targeting Script Debugger; Script Debugger will implicitly be the tell target.</p>

    <p>However, for development and debugging purposes it is better to supply an explicit <code>tell</code> block (<code>tell application "Script Debugger"</code>), because if you don&#8217;t, the returned values in the <a href="../../developfolder/runfolder/result.html">result</a> could be less helpful.</p>

    <p>Script Debugger will appear among the applications listed under <a href="../../explorefolder/dictionafolder/opendictfolder/currentappdict.html">File &gt; Open Dictionary</a>, in the <a href="../../explorefolder/dictionafolder/opendictfolder/dictionariesinsp.html">dictionaries inspector</a>, and in the <a href="../../explorefolder/dictionafolder/dictwindow.html">dictionary window</a>, so you can easily <a href="../../explorefolder/dictionafolder/opendict.html">open its dictionary</a>.</p>

    <p>The dictionary is fairly self-explanatory, so a detailed discussion of scripting Script Debugger should be unnecessary. But here are a few points that deserve attention.</p>

    <h3 id="opening-things">Opening Things</h3>

    <p>Some kinds of Script Debugger <a href="../windows.html">window</a> can be opened. Here are some examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>To create a new empty script window, say <code>make new document</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To open a script from disk, say <code>open alias "vol:folder:file.scpt"</code>. The result is a reference to the document.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To open an application&#8217;s dictionary, open the application itself. The simplest approach is to take advantage of <code>path to application</code>; so, for example, <code>open (path to application "BBedit")</code>.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, say <code>make new dictionary window</code>. This creates an empty dictionary window, not displaying any application&#8217;s dictionary.</p>

        <p>Once you have a dictionary window, you can change what application&#8217;s dictionary it displays by setting its <code>file spec</code> property. For example, <code>set file spec of dictionary window 1 to (path to application "BBEdit")</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To open a script window&#8217;s event log window, tell the document to <code>make new event log window</code>. The event log window and the document have pointers to one another.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To open a script window&#8217;s result explorer window, tell the document to <code>open last result</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>All open windows are elements of the application object. You can get a complete list by asking for <code>every window</code>, or you can get a list of windows in a particular category by asking for e.g. <code>every dictionary window</code> or <code>every script window</code>.</p>

    <p>Every <code>script window</code> is associated with exactly one <code>document</code> (it has a <code>document</code> property). The two classes are not interchangeable, but a script window and its document have the same id. This is fairly standard Cocoa Scripting stuff.</p>

    <p>Documents are numbered front to back, so the numbering is volatile. In other words, <code>document 1</code> is the document of whatever script window is frontmost at that moment.</p>

    <h3 id="closing-things">Closing Things</h3>

    <p>To close a window, use the <code>close</code> command.</p>

    <p>However, when your script running within Script Debugger wants to close a script window (or document), you <em>must</em> provide the full form and you must <em>not</em> use the <code>saving ask</code> option, or Script Debugger will throw an error. So, for example, you can say <code>close document 2 without saving</code>, and you can say <code>close document 2 saving yes</code> if the file has been previously saved, but you cannot say simply <code>close document 2</code>, nor can you say <code>close document 2 saving ask</code>.</p>

    <p>By the same token, if document 2 has never been saved, you cannot say simply <code>save document 2</code>. You must supply the full form, with an <code>in</code> parameter specifying where to save.</p>

    <p>The reason is that when Script Debugger is scripting itself, we cannot pause the script while the user interacts with the &#8220;Do you want to save changes?&#8221; dialog or the Save File dialog. So you must avert such interaction by stating explicitly what you want done with the document.</p>

    <h3 id="manipulating-things">Manipulating Things</h3>

    <p>As you would expect, most interaction with objects occurs by way of their properties. Look, for example, at the properties of a document or a dictionary window or an event log window to see all the manipulations you can perform. For example, to switch a script to debug mode, set the document&#8217;s <code>debugger enabled</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to manipulate the <em>contents</em> of a script. First, you can get or set a script&#8217;s <em>entire</em> contents as text, through the document&#8217;s <code>script source</code> property; you can also get and set a script&#8217;s entire contents as a script object, through the document&#8217;s <code>script</code> property.</p>

    <p>You can also manipulate a script&#8217;s <em>selection</em>. If you <code>get selection</code> you are handed mere text, but if you ask for <code>selection as point</code> or <code>character range of selection</code>, what you get is a list of two integers, the character offset after the insertion point or the start of the selection (the first character offset is 1) and the count of characters in the selection. Similarly, you can <code>set selection</code> to alter the selected text, but if what you set the selection to is a list of two integers, or if you <code>set character range of selection</code> to such a list, you reposition the selection.</p>

    <p>So, for example, here&#8217;s a crude but effective utility for selecting a given line of a given script:</p>

    <pre><code>on selectLine(num, docnum)
    tell application "Script Debugger"
        tell document docnum
            set L to every paragraph of (get script source)
            set offs to 1
            repeat with i from 1 to (num - 1)
                set aLine to item i of L
                set offs to offs + (length of aLine) + 1
            end repeat
            set selection to {offs, length of item num of L}
        end tell
    end tell
end selectLine
selectLine(3, 2) -- <i>or whatever</i>
</code></pre>

    <h3 id="running-scripts">Running Scripts</h3>

    <p>Script Debugger provides a repertory of specialized commands for making a script (a <code>document</code>) do such things as <code>compile</code>, <code>execute</code>, <code>step into</code>, and so on. Execution causes compilation, obviously. After calling any command that causes compilation, you can check whether compilation succeeded by examining the document&#8217;s <code>compiled</code> property.</p>

    <p>Some of these commands come with a caveat: <code>execute</code>, <code>pause</code>, <code>step into</code>, <code>step out</code>, and <code>step over</code> all share the feature that they can return before the script has stopped or paused (and <code>start recording</code> can return before the script has started recording). This is a consequence of Script Debugger&#8217;s multi-threaded architecture.</p>

    <p>The correct approach, therefore, if you wish to proceed after the script has done what you asked it to do, is to poll the document&#8217;s <code>execution state</code> property. So, for example, here&#8217;s a script that provides a utility for waiting until the document is paused or stopped, and shows how to use it in connection with <code>execute</code>.</p>

    <pre><code>on waitUntilReady(d)
    repeat while execution state of d is not in {stopped, paused}
        delay 0.2
    end repeat
end waitUntilReady
-- <i>and here's how to use it</i>
tell application "Script Debugger"
    set d to document "convertFigures"
    tell d
        execute
        my waitUntilReady(d)
        if not compiled then return last error message -- <i>compilation failed, get error</i>
        if last error message is not missing value then -- <i>execution failed, get error</i>
            return last error message
        end if
        return last result -- <i>execution succeeded, get result</i>
    end tell
end tell
</code></pre>

    <h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h3>

    <p>We&#8217;d like to provide fuller scriptability, but this takes work, so we would prefer to go in directions that our users will actually use. If Script Debugger&#8217;s scriptability lacks a feature you need, do let us know.</p>
