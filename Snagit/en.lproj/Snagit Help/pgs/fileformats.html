<h2>Save as file formats:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SNAGPROJ: </strong>Snagit Project File Type is a Snagit file format that retains vector-based objects such as arrows and callouts. Other file formats flatten all vector objects to make the objects a permanent part of the image. SNAGPROJ files allow you to edit captures and vector objects at a later time. This file format is only compatible with the Snagit Mac and cannot be opened in other applications.</li>
  <li><strong>PNG: </strong>Portable Network Graphic. PNG format is a lossless compression file format, which makes it a common choice for the web. With lossless files, when the file is compressed, it maintains the same quality as the original capture. PNG supports transparency with a 32 bit color depth. PNG has smaller file sizes than other lossless formats (like BMP), but still produces larger files than a lossy format (like JPG).</li>
  <li><strong>JPEG: </strong>This format is a lossy compressed file format, which means the quality degrades when compressed. It is useful for storing photographs at a smaller size than a BMP. JPG is common for use on the web since it is compressed. For saving line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a smaller file size, GIF or PNG are better choices since they are lossless.</li>
  <li><strong>TIFF: </strong>The TIFF file format is often used for document scanning, as well as the format used when dragging and dropping images on MAC OS X.</li>
  <li><strong>GIF: </strong>The Graphics Interchange format is an older file format. GIF only supports 256 colors per image. This limited color palette can lead to color banding on images with lots of colors or gradients. The limited colors result in a smaller file size, but a lower quality image. GIF supports full color transparency only.</li>
  <li><strong>BMP: </strong>The Windows bitmap image format is a lossless format, but unlike the lossless PNG format, BMP does not compress file size. This can result in very large files. Unless you have a specific need for a BMP file, the lossless and compressed PNG format is better for your images. Transparency in BMP files is not supported in Snagit.</li>

<h2>Video file format</h2>
<p>Snagit saves the video captures as MPEG-4 files in the <a href="advancedpref.html">Autosave</a> folder. To learn more about video sharing options, see <a href="outputs.html">Snagit Outputs</a>.</p>
