    <p id="id51495465572C4AA79518EA13A65347A5" class="bodyText">Storyist is a creative writing application for Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later. Designed specifically for novelists and screenwriters, it provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A word processor with a page layout view and support for headers, footers, and style sheets.</li>
      <li>An outliner.</li>
      <li>A storyboard with support for index cards and photos.</li>
      <li>Customizable story sheets.</li>
      <li>A project manager with fast, project-wide search capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="idFD3C49BFF1EF48B18EC3CF3689D069D0" class="heading3">Benefits</h3>
    <p id="id9C6B5D4C3D1D410FB9C015DD6D606881" class="bodyText"><i>Produces submission-ready manuscripts and scripts</i>. Storyist comes with several project templates that provide style sheets for industry-standard formatting. You don’t have to set the margins, font, line spacing, or anything else; just start typing, and you can produce a submission-ready manuscript or script.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">But if you want to change the format, you can. Like most creative writing applications, Storyist provides a full complement of word processing tools, including spelling and grammar checking. But unlike some of the competing packages, Storyist also provides a page layout view and support for headers, footers, and style sheets so there is no need to export your finished draft to another word processor for final formatting. </p>
    <p class="bodyText"><i>Provides a high-level view of your story</i>. The storyboarding tools in Storyist allow you to sketch out a story using photographs and index cards and then refine it with customizable plot, character, and setting sheets. For writers who prefer a more traditional approach, Storyist provides an outliner for working with story elements in outline form.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><i>Keeps all your writing organized and accessible</i>. The Project view lets you see your story elements at a glance and allows you to create and arrange them. The search field lets you quickly find what you’re looking for anywhere in your project and return to your writing.</p>
    <h3 id="idC22913D04CCC4B64817971DDCDD003CA" class="heading3">Features at a Glance</h3>
    <p id="id7468BE30217B438BB7BD7EE2EF819D57" class="bodyText">Designed with novelists and screenwriters in mind, Storyist includes a number of story development power tools:</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>The Storyboard</b>. Sometimes you want to put a face to a name. Storyist lets you cast your novel or screenplay with images from your photo collection or from the web. You can also view, edit, and arrange your scenes and plot points using virtual index cards on a cork board. And Storyist automatically transfers your storyboard information to story sheets for in-depth development.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>The Outliner</b>. A flexible outlining tool lets you display and edit not only your section or scene summaries, but also your plot, character, and setting notes.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Customizable story sheets</b>. Story sheets are editable forms tailored for novel writing and screenwriting. You use them to record information about various aspects of your story, such as a character’s age or a description of a setting. Storyist comes with story sheets for plot, character, setting, and section/scene. And story sheets are customizable, so you can capture the information you want to capture.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Project-wide search</b>. As you develop your story, your page count grows, and so does your collection of notes about your story—plot, character, and setting notes. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to quickly find what you’ve written when you need it? With Storyist, you can. The search field, visible at all times in the toolbar, helps you quickly find the information you are looking for.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Full-screen Editing.</b> Want to remove the distractions and focus on your writing? The full-screen editing mode puts the whole screen at your disposal, turning your computer into a dedicated writing environment.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Wiki linking</b>. Your notes become much more valuable when you can describe the relationships between them with links. Using a simple Wiki syntax, you can quickly create links to any item in your project, and even create the items themselves. And when you do, Storyist maintains your links for you. If you change the title of a notebook entry, the titles of any links to it update automatically. If you move a plot point to a new section, plot point links in your Section Sheets adjust accordingly.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Smart text</b>. In screenplay mode, Storyist collects your scene introductions, locations, times, character names, and transitions as you type and auto-completes them for you when you need them.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Quick styles</b>. Tab and Return key shortcuts make changing between standard novel or screenplay elements as simple as typing a key or two. And with key equivalents for all of the styles in your style sheet, you can focus on writing, not formatting.</p>
