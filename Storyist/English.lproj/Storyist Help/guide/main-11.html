    <p id="id887AFF13B0334E14BE23FCC21BB11251" class="bodyText">Storyist automatically saves a copy of your work every few minutes to help minimize data loss in case of power failure or other unforeseen circumstances. If Storyist should quit unexpectedly, it will restore your project from the automatically saved copy the next time you launch the application.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">For newly created projects, Storyist saves your changes in a temporary location on your hard disk. After you save your new project to its permanent location, Storyist continues automatically saving your work to the location you've chosen.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">Storyist also begins making periodic copies of your entire project. These copies are referred to as versions. Versions are created each time you open a project and every hour while you’re working on it.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">You can view these automatically saved versions and compare them to the current project using the Versions Browser as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the project whose previous versions you want to view.</li>
      <li>Choose File &gt; Revert To &gt; Browse All Versions.</li>
      <li>Click the timeline on the right to move forward and backward in the version history.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="p1"></p>
    <p class="p1">The Versions Browser is integrated with Apple's Time Machine backup software, so if you set up Time Machine, you'll be able to browse versions that are saved not only on your local machine, but on your Time Machine hard drive as well.</p>
    <p class="p1"></p>
    <p class="p1">To make efficient use of space, OS X periodically prunes the automatically created version of a project on your hard drive, keeping hourly versions for a day, daily versions for a month, and weekly versions for all previous months.</p>
    <p class="p1"></p>
    <p class="p1">OS X does not prune any versions you create manually (see below).</p>
    <p class="p1"></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>Note:</b> If you prefer to see a simple list of previous versions, you can use the File &gt; Show Previous Versions command.</p>

    <p id="id87739F06FCD44FC88053C4FD24B5D467" class="bodyText">You can also save a version of your work manually. You might choose to do this after completing a draft, before starting a round of revisions, or before trying a scene you are not sure you’re going to keep.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">To save a version manually:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose File &gt; Save a Version. A dialog appears.</li>
      <li>Enter a comment to help you identify this version.</li>
      <li>Click Save a Version.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="bodyList"></p>
    <p class="bodyText">Alternately:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose File &gt; Show Previous Versions. The versions list appears.</li>
      <li>Click the Save a Version button. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="id3BE216C2BA9C48E59FCA508271399579" class="heading2">Reverting to a Previous Version</h2>
    <p id="idB1A65A303C9F40F7ADF076B271FA0F3A" class="bodyText">If you're not happy with the changes you’ve made to your story, it is easy to return to a previously saved version:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Versions Browser as described above.</li>
      <li>Location the revision you want to restore.</li>
      <li>Click Restore.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="p2"></p>
    <p class="bodyText">Alternately:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose File &gt; Show Previous Versions. </li>
      <li>Select the version you want, and click Restore Version. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="p1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project now contains the contents of the previous version of your project.</li>
    </ul>
