    <p id="id9C6BE448CE4547C485FE9A1A6EF16D0B" class="bodyText">When you're writing, you probably want to arrange your windows and views to focus on the manuscript or screenplay. When you're outlining, you likely want to use the Outline view. When you're revising, you may want to see the manuscript and screenplay along with your notes.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">It can be cumbersome to size your views and configure the display preferences to suit your needs, so Storyist provides the ability to create workspace snapshots to quickly recall your settings.</p>
    <h2 id="idCF6068E3B66C4105BED6D3794F711088" class="heading2">Splitting Views</h2>
    <p id="id91654D42409E4B5B92CDD6957A5E1B6F" class="bodyText">You can split a view horizontally or vertically. Storyist even lets you nest split views, so you can create quite complex view arrangements.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">To split a view, position the cursor in the view you want to split, and then choose one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View &gt; Split &gt; Split Active View Horizontally. The active view is split so that the views are stacked one on top of the other.</li>
      <li>View &gt; Split &gt; Split Active View Vertically. The active view is split so that the views are arranged side by side.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodyList"></p>
    <p class="bodyText">To close the active split view, choose View &gt; Split &gt; Close Active Split View.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">To close all split views but the currently active view, choose View &gt; Split &gt; Close Others.</p>
    <h2 id="idEE6FFCB36B0641A685C2E3F06E7108FA" class="heading2">Changing the Orientation of Split Views</h2>
    <p id="id423B201E9A1D4A29BB6F847CE0383ADE" class="bodyText">If you want to change the orientation of a split view (that is, you want to change from a vertical split to a horizontal split or vice versa), choose Window &gt; Workspaces &gt; Rotate Workspace.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Note:</b> This command changes the orientation of the outer split views. Nested split views are not affected.</p>
    <h2 id="id70524B31A0C440F0922944F37A620FFF" class="heading2">Opening a New Project Window</h2>
    <p id="id9E199F3A940B4B9E9713E1AF6FD9EBAE" class="bodyText">Sometimes it is useful to have multiple project windows open. Not only can you see multiple project documents at one time, you can take advantage of Spaces to streamline your workflow.</p>

      <li>The split view sizes and arrangement.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="idE090BF89AD464A92AD7BD1D2B2973810" class="heading2">Managing Workspaces</h2>
