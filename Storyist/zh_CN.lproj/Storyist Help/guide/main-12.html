    <p id="idFBDF47CD9B194B4DB92CAD731770CCB3" class="bodyText">When you choose the "Files" option in the Export popup button in the export dialog, the Format popup button presents the following file format options:</p>

    <p class="p2"></p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Note:</b> Image items are exported in their native format. That is, they are exported in the format they were in when added to the project.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">When you click the Next button in the export dialog, Storyist begins the export process.  For the file export process, there is only one step.</p>
    <h3 id="id39C83D1E15DC425DA062B4F664EC133D" class="heading3">Step 1 of 1: Select Export Options</h3>
    <p id="id1431F69C46E540EC895C6F77FDFD08A4" class="bodyText">This pane has two check boxes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><i>Export to folders matching the project structure</i>. Select this option to have Storyist create subfolders in the export directory with the same structure as the folders in your project. If you leave this option unchecked, Storyist places all exported items in a single directory.</li>
      <li><i>Process text files with workflow</i>. Select this option to have Storyist process each text file with the workflow indicated in the workflow popup button next to the checkbox. The workflow popup button displays both the built-in workflows and the ones you create yourself with Automator. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="bodyList"></p>
    <p class="bodyText">You can optionally have Storyist guide you through the individual steps of the workflow by checking the "Guide me through the workflow steps" checkbox. If you select this option, Storyist adds additional steps (panes) to the export process, one for each workflow action, allowing you to adjust the settings.</p>
    <p class="p3">The Edit Workflow button opens the selected workflow in Automator for editing. If the selected workflow is a built-in workflow, Storyist first makes a copy of the workflow in the Library/Application Support/Storyist/Workflows/Export folder in your home directory.</p>
    <p class="p3">The Show Workflow Folder button opens the workflow folder in Finder. Workflows are located in the Library/Application Support/Storyist/Workflows/Export folder in your home directory. If you create your own workflow with Automator, be sure to save the workflow in this folder.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"><b>Note:</b> Workflows created with Automator must consist only of actions that take "Storyist Styled Text" for input and output. For more information on using Automator, please see the <i>Automator User's Guide</i>.</p>
