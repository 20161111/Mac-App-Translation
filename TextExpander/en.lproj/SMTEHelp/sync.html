      <h1><a href="index.html">Help</a>: Syncing Snippets</h1>

        <p>Setup TextExpander to sync your snippets by saving the snippets file to any syncing folder on your Mac. Examples of cloud services that can be setup as syncing folders are iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.</p>

<h3>Setup Sync</h3>

<ol>
<li>On your first computer (the one with your snippets) open TextExpander to Preferences &gt; Sync and click <strong>Save Snippets As…</strong></li>
<li>Select a location to store your snippet file, Settings.textexpandersettings. In order to make the snippets sync choose a location which syncs, such as a Dropbox or Google Drive folder. </li>
<li>On your second Mac open TextExpander to Preferences > Sync and click <strong>Link to Snippets…</strong> Locate the snippet file just saved. It will be located in whichever folder is synced with your first Mac.<br />
Or, if your second device is an iPad or iPhone, open TextExpander touch to Settings &gt; Synchronization, choose <strong>Link to Snippets…</strong> and locate your snippet file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Sync with older TextExpander versions</h3>

<p>If you use an older version of TextExpander (4.x and earlier) or TextExpander touch (3.4 and earlier) you can only use Dropbox to sync your snippets. To continue syncing with these versions successfully:</p>

<ol>
<li>In Preferences &gt; Sync turn on <strong>Sync with TextExpander 4 or TextExpander touch 3.4 (Dropbox only)</strong>. This will place your snippet file here: Dropbox &gt; TextExpander &gt; Settings.textexpander.</li>
<li>On your second Mac, the one running TextExpander 4 or earlier, go to TextExpander's Preferences &gt; Sync and check &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo;. <br />
Or, if your second device is an iPad or iPhone running TextExpander touch 3.4 or earlier, go to TextExpander touch's Settings &gt; Synchronization and set &quot;Use Dropbox&quot; to &quot;On&quot;.</li></li>
<li>When given the option, choose &quot;Link to Dropbox Data.&quot;</li>
</ol>


      <h3>Transfer Snippets</h3>
          <p>If you do not have sync setup, or do not want to use sync, you can still transfer your snippets from one device to another over your local network. Each transfer is a one-way transfer that copies your snippets to another device. When transferring to or from an iOS Device, you can only transfer one group at a time.</p>
           <ul>
             <li><strong>Mac to Mac</strong></li>
            <p>If you are transferring your snippets from one computer to another, you can copy the settings file, Settings.textexpandersettings (v5.x and later) or Settings.textexpander (v4.x and earlier), which contains all of your snippets, and move it to a second computer. TextExpander places this file in the following default location, but you can place it anywhere assuming you are using v5.x or later:</p>
             <ul>
              <p>[Home] / Library / Application Support / TextExpander / Settings.textexpander</p>
           <p>To access your [Home] / Library folder on OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later, please hold the Option key and choose Go > Library from the menu in the Finder.</p>
             </ul>
             <li><strong>Mac to iOS Device</strong></li>
            <p>Important: Your Mac and your iOS Device must be on the same WiFi network. On your Mac, go to TextExpander's Preferences > Sync and make sure to check &quot;Share groups on local network.&quot;</p>
              <ol>
               <li>On your iOS Device, from the Snippet Groups screen of TextExpander touch, tap the plus (+) button at the bottom.</li>
               <li>Tap &quot;Add via Local Network.&quot;</li>
               <li>Tap the name of the Mac from which you'd like to add a snippet group.</li>
               <li>Tap the name of the group you'd like to add.</li>
               <li>An alert will appear in TextExpander on your Mac asking you to confirm that you want to send the group to your iOS Device. Click &quot;Send.&quot;</li>
              </ol>

             <li><strong>iOS Device to Mac / iOS Device to iOS Device</strong></li>
            <p>Important: Your Mac and your iOS Device must be on the same WiFi network. On your iOS Device go to TextExpander's Settings &gt; Local Network Sharing and turn on &quot;Share Groups.&quot;</p>
              <ol>
               <li>From the Snippet Groups screen, tap the snippet group you want to send.</li>
               <li>Tap the Share button at the bottom left.</li>
               <li>Tap &quot;Send via Local Network.&quot;</li>
               <li>You’ll see a list of available Macs and iOS Devices on the network. Tap the name of the device where you want to send your snippet group.</li>
               <li>That device will display an alert asking for confirmation. Click &quot;Add&quot; and your snippets will be added to TextExpander on that device.</li>
              </ol>
           </ul>
