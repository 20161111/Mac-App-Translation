	<h1>Welcome to TextExpander</h1>
<p>TextExpander can save you a lot of time and effort. Anything that you type over and over can be made into a TextExpander snippet. Once you've done that, you never have to type it out again--just type a short abbreviation instead.</p>

<h2>How Do I Create Snippets?</h2>
<p>TextExpander comes with a few default snippets, but we want to make it easy for you to create personalized snippets that you will use, so you can start enjoying the time-saving power of TextExpander right away!</p>

<h2>We Can Help!</h2>
<p>This Snippet Creation Assistant takes you through the steps of creating snippets for your email address, your email signature, your home address, your website and more. It will also show you how to use special snippet groups for correcting typos, shortening URLs and even adding accent marks to words.</p>
