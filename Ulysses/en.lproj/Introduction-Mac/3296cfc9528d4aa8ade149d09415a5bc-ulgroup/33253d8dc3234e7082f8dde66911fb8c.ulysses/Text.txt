### Navigation, Editor
- At the start of a sheet:

### Copy & Move in Sidebars
- By default, dragging groups and sheets to and from iCloud or “On My Mac” will always _move_, i.e. contents will get transferred to the new location
- Dragging to and from Daedalus and External Folders will always _copy_, i.e. contents will live in both locations afterwards
- Hold `⌥` while dragging, to force _copy_ of groups and sheets
- Hold `⌘` while dragging, to force _move_ of groups and sheets
