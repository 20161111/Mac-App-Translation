### Screen Modes
- `⌥⌘L` to toggle Dark Theme
- `⌃⌘F` to toggle Full Screen Mode
- `⌥⌘X` to toggle Dark Mode

### Multiple Windows, Split View

- You can have multiple windows open at the same time (`⌥⌘N`)
- We support OS X’ Split View, so you can display two windows next to each other in Split View.
- You can also display a Ulysses sheet next to another app in Split View, or next to its own preview.
- You can even have the same sheet visible in all open windows, which makes for some fancy show-off while editing, but it’s of not much use, to be honest.

### Sheet List Options
- The View menu holds several options for personalizing the sheet list:
	- Set the “Sheet Preview” to anything between 1 and 6 lines
	- Include Keywords and Goals in the sheet preview
	- Either sort manually, by date or by first character   

### Editor Options
- The View menu also holds options for personalizing the editor:
	- `⌥⌘T` to toggle Typewriter Scrolling
		- You can set this to top, center or bottom
		- You can also set this to be fixed or variable
	- Enable a highlight for the currently selected line
	- Enable the display of paragraph numbers

### Font Size
- `⌘+` to increase font size
- `⌘-` to decrease font size
- `⌘0` to reset font size to default value
