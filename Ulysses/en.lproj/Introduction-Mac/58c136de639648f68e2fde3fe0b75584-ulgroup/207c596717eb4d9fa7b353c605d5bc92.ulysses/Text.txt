## Ulysses for iPhone and iPad

If you own Ulysses for iPhone and iPad (and, frankly, ￼you should￼), now is a good time to enable iCloud on your devices. You will be able to edit all your texts on your iPhone and/or iPad. There’s no further setup necessary, no linking, nothing.

Start writing at home and continue on the road. Or the coffee shop. Or the beach. The bed. The couch. The Eiffel Tower. Mount Everest. ISS. Kepler 21b. So cool.
