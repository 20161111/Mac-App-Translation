## Sheets

All writing is done in Ulysses’ sheets. Sheets are somewhat equivalent to classic documents, though they don’t require a “title” or a “file name” or such.

You create sheets via `⌘N` or the new sheet button in toolbar.

Sheets can hold any amount of text, and you can freely move sheets around and sort them at will. You can also select multiple sheets and glue them together (`⌘J`). They will then behave as a single sheet in the editor, which is especially cool if you rather have a lot of small chunks than a single, monolithic wall of text.

You can also split a sheet in two at the current cursor position (Edit › Split at Selection), and merge two or more sheets together to form one (File › Merge Sheets).


### Added bonus

Since sheets are likely to live in the vicinity of other sheets, we figured it would be nice if you could easily navigate between them — right from within the editor. There are keyboard shortcuts for this (`⌥⌘↓/↑`).

You should try this now to get the hang of it. Just come back here, as we’re about to look at the cool stuff.
