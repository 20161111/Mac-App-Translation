## Ok, but How Do I…?

Let’s first get you some sense of direction. Here is an UI-overview from left to right:

- LIBRARY
- SHEET LIST
- EDITOR

The _library_ lets you access all your texts and is divided into sections. Depending on whether you’ve got iCloud enabled, you will see different sections here.

The _sheet list_ is where all your texts reside.

And this here is the _editor_.

To switch between three pane (library, sheet list and editor), two pane (sheet list and editor) and editor only view, use the shortcuts `⌘1`, `⌘2` and `⌘3`. You can also switch views via the leftmost toolbar button.
