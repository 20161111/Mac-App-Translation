## External Folders

In External Folders, you can edit classic text and markdown files from anywhere on your Mac. As an example, you can point Ulysses to a folder on Dropbox, and have its contents behave just like native groups and sheets. Make sure that “External Folders” are enabled in preferences, then add one via the `+` button in the respective section header of the library.

Some features will be limited for external folders (no images, no attachments). Writing, however, will still be great. And this is what counts after all, isn’t it?
