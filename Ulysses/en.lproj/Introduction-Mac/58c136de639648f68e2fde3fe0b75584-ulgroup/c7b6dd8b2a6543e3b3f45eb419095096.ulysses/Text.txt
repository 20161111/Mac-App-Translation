## Library: Groups & Filters

Groups and filters are your main tools to keep your library organized. They’re similar to Finder’s folders and smart folders.

You add groups and filters via the File menu. You can place groups and filters inside other groups. If you select a group in the library, its contents will show up in the sheet list. Select a sheet, and it shows up in the editor.

Filters are a special kind of group. Once set up, they will look at the group they’re in and list all sheets that match the set criteria. For example, you can set up a filter that only lists sheets with a keyword “fantastic”. If you place it deep within a nested group, say, six levels down, the filter will only show matching sheets within that very group.

You can even select multiple groups and filters (by holding down `⌘`), and get their combined contents listed in the sheet list.
